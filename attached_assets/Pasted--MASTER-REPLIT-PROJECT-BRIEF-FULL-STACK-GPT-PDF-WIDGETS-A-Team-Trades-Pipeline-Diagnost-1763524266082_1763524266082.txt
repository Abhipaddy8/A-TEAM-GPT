GPT dynamically fills in personalised content


Backend uses the same Markdown→PDF conversion every time

The landing page chat will rely on these instructions

🎯 8. GOAL FOR THE COMPLETED PROJECT
Replit must deliver a system where:
✔ A builder visits the landing page
✔ A GPT-driven widget chat runs the diagnostic
✔ GPT collects email via a form widget
✔ Backend generates a fully personalised PDF
✔ PDF emailed + downloadable via chat widget
✔ GPT collects phone number via widget
✔ Backend sends SMS
✔ GPT shows CTA panel with button
✔ Backend tracks CTA click → updates GHL
Everything is automated.
 Everything uses GPT widgets.
 Everything feels premium and visual.


🔵 2️⃣ USER JOURNEY FLOW (End-to-End) — FINAL BRIEF FOR REPLIT
This section tells Replit exactly how the system behaves when a real user interacts with your GPT on the landing page. It MUST be followed exactly.

🟦 Step 1 — User Enters GPT From Ad or Link
The user arrives from a UTM-tracked link such as:
https://developcoaching.co.uk/schedule-a-call/?utm_source=gpt&utm_medium=ai&utm_campaign=a_team_trades_pipeline

The landing page must:
render your ChatGPT assistant via the ChatGPT SDK


pass UTM params into the assistant context


display a branded chat window using GPT widgets


There is no backend interaction yet.

🟦 Step 2 — GPT Runs the Full 7-Question Diagnostic
Inside the chat:
GPT shows Question 1 of 7 (widgets encouraged)


User answers


GPT moves to next question


Continue until all 7 are completed


After Question 7:
GPT internally calculates:


Total score (0–100)


Section scores


R/A/G statuses


Labour leak


Bottlenecks


GPT does NOT reveal internal logic.
GPT must present the results using widgets, not plain text:
Cards for section scores


Tables for breakdown


Panels for insights


Badges for R/A/G


No PDF.
 No email yet.

🟦 Step 3 — Email Capture (REQUIRED)
Once diagnostic results are shown, GPT must say (exact wording):
“I can send you the full personalised report.
 Drop your email below and I’ll send it instantly.”
This must use a Form Widget:
{
  "type": "form",
  "fields": [
    { "id": "email", "label": "Your Email", "type": "email", "required": true }
  ],
  "submit_label": "Send My Report"
}

Once submitted:
GPT sends collected email + score + insights to backend via POST /submitEmail.


Backend generates PDF + emails it + updates GHL.


GPT must then say:
“Great — I’m generating your PDF now.”

🟦 Step 4 — Phone Number Capture (Optional Bonus)
After email submission is done AND backend responds successfully:
GPT must say:
“I’ve also got a bonus most builders love —
 I can text you the A-Team Trades Quick Win Pack (3 fast fixes for your labour pipeline).
 Want it?
 If yes, drop your mobile number.
 If not, just type ‘Skip.’”
If user gives phone:
GPT calls backend POST /submitPhone


Backend:


Updates GHL


Tags: Ateam-SMS-OK


Sends SMS


If user types “Skip”:
GPT skips


No backend call



🟦 Step 5 — GPT Thanks Them + Redirects
After phone step:
GPT must say:
“Your report is on its way.
 If you want help fixing your score, book a Scale Session call here.”
Then show a CTA Button Widget:
{
  "type": "button",
  "label": "Book My Scale Session Call",
  "href": "https://your-backend-url.com/visit?cid={{contact_id}}"
}

Click result:
Backend tracks the visit


Updates GHL


Redirects user to booking link



🟩 3️⃣ REPORT DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS — FINAL VERSION
When GPT calls /submitEmail, backend must:
1. Generate PDF using Markdown from GPT
Markdown template must include:
Cover page (title, branding, date, builder name)


Executive summary


Section traffic-light scoring


Commentary for each section


Personalised recommendations


Labour risk profile


Labour-leak projection


Final CTA page with branding


2. Convert Markdown → PDF using md-to-pdf
No Puppeteer.
 No HTML rendering.
 No CSS complexity.
3. Email PDF to user
Subject: Your A-Team Trades Pipeline™ Score Report - SEND IT FROM WIHTIN GHL ONLY
 Attachment: PDF
 Optional link: PDF URL
4. Update GoHighLevel
Tag: Ateam-GPT
 Custom fields:
Score


UTM values


Phone opt-in


PDF link


Session ID


converted_YN (later)


5. Return success to GPT
Payload:
{
  "success": true,
  "pdf_url": "https://..."
}

GPT then continues flow.

🎯 This is the exact user-journey specification all layers must follow:
✔ ChatGPT widget UI for questions


✔ Backend for email/PDF/CRM


✔ Phone step optional


✔ CTA tracking


✔ Report PDF generation & email


If you want, I can now integrate this user journey into:
✔ The final FULL Replit brief (merged into one doc)
✔ The CustomGPT instruction set
✔ The backend architecture
✔ The widget-based assistant script
✔ The Markdown PDF template
Just say:
 👉 “Combine everything into one Replit master spec.”
